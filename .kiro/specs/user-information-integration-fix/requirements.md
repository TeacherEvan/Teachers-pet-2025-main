# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Teachers Pet application is experiencing critical errors where user information is not being properly utilized in comment generation. The application has missing JavaScript dependencies, inconsistent data flow between pages, and incomplete integration between the user input collection system and the comment generation engine. This feature addresses these issues to ensure all user-provided information is correctly captured, stored, and used in the final comment generation process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher using the application, I want all student information I enter to be properly saved and used in comment generation, so that the generated comments accurately reflect the specific student data I provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters student information on the student-information.html page THEN the system SHALL save all form data including name, gender, strengths, weaknesses, and overall rating to localStorage
2. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain all previously entered data without loss
3. WHEN the comment generation process begins THEN the system SHALL retrieve and use all stored user information including student name, gender, strengths, weaknesses, and performance ratings
4. WHEN comments are generated THEN the system SHALL incorporate the student's specific name, correct pronouns, listed strengths, areas for improvement, and selected subjects into the final output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the application to work without JavaScript errors, so that I can complete the report generation process smoothly without interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads any page THEN the system SHALL load without 404 errors for JavaScript files
2. WHEN missing JavaScript dependencies are encountered THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality or create the missing files
3. WHEN the user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL respond without console errors
4. WHEN the comment generation process runs THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without throwing JavaScript exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the data flow between pages to be seamless and reliable, so that I don't lose my work when moving through the application workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the student information form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before allowing navigation
2. WHEN the user moves from student information to subject selection THEN the system SHALL transfer all student data correctly
3. WHEN the user selects subjects and topics THEN the system SHALL combine this data with the previously entered student information
4. WHEN the final comment generation occurs THEN the system SHALL have access to all collected data from all previous steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the comment generation to use all the specific details I provided about the student, so that the generated comments are personalized and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating comments THEN the system SHALL use the exact student name provided in multiple places throughout the comment
2. WHEN generating comments THEN the system SHALL use the correct pronouns based on the selected gender
3. WHEN generating comments THEN the system SHALL incorporate the specific strengths listed by the teacher
