## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Loading Priority

In `Subjects.html`, scripts load in this order:

```html
<script src="assets/js/comment-engine.js"></script>      <!-- Original -->
<script src="assets/js/enhanced-comment-engine.js"></script>  <!-- New (priority) -->
<script src="enhanced-comment-engine.js"></script>       <!-- Backup path -->
<script src="missing-functions.js"></script>             <!-- Uses engine -->
```

### Engine Selection Logic

In `missing-functions.js`:

```javascript
if (typeof EnhancedCommentEngine !== 'undefined') {
    console.log('‚úÖ Using Enhanced Comment Engine');
    const enhancedEngine = new EnhancedCommentEngine();
    comments = enhancedEngine.generateComments(sessionData);
} else if (typeof PremiumCommentEngine !== 'undefined') {
    console.log('‚úÖ Using Premium Comment Engine (fallback)');
    const engine = new PremiumCommentEngine();
    comments = engine.generateComments(sessionData);
}
```

**Result:** Enhanced engine is always preferred, with graceful fallback.
